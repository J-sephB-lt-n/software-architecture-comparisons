I am writing a simple e-commerce shopping cart/order system in python.
The point of this app is that I am going to refactor it multiple times in order to show how it will look under these different architectures:

- Clean
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event-driven
- Service-Oriented
- Modular monolith
- Ports and adapters (hexagonal)
- n-tier
- layered
- MVC
- vertical slice
- domain-driven design
- onion
- microservices

Enumerate all of the functionality (features) which I might include in this app, and then find me the smallest subset of features which will allow me to cleanly contrast these different architectures (i.e. the smallest simplest app code possible, but with enough features that the code looks significantly different under each architecture).
