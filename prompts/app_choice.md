I want a very simple application which I can rewrite many times using different software architectures.
What would be a good choice of example application?
I want the code to be as short and simple as possible, since the focus is on architecture.
The app code organisation must look very different under these architectures:

- Clean
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event-driven
- Service-Oriented
- Modular monolith
- Ports and adapters (hexagonal)
- n-tier
- layered
- MVC
- vertical slice
- domain-driven design
- onion
- microservices

Discuss a few alternatives first, and then give me your final answer with motivation.
