I am writing a simple e-commerce shopping cart/order system in python.
The point of this app is that I am going to refactor it multiple times in order to show how it will look under these different architectures:

- Clean
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event-driven
- Service-Oriented
- Modular monolith
- Ports and adapters (hexagonal)
- n-tier
- layered
- MVC
- vertical slice
- domain-driven design
- onion
- microservices

If I make a web interface for the app, will that better illustrate the differences between the architectures? Or will a CLI interface suffice?
Discuss pros and cons of each option first, then give me your final answer with motivation.
