# General Principles
You must always write code that (where relevant) fulfils all of the requirements of high quality code:
- **Functionality (correctness)** : Works as expected and fulfills its intended purpose.
- **Readability**: Is easy for humans to understand. Code is optimised for clarity.
- **Documentation**: Clearly explains its purpose and usage.
- **Standards Compliance**: Adheres to conventions and guidelines (e.g. PEP 8 for python code).
- **Reusability**: Can be used in different contexts without modification.
- **Maintainability**: Allows for modifications and extensions without introducing bugs.
- **Robustness**: Handles errors and unexpected inputs effectively.
- **Testability**: Can be easily verified for correctness.
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes time and resource usage.
- **Scalability**: Handles increased data loads or complexity without degradation.
- **Security**: Protects against vulnerabilities and malicious inputs.

# Documentation
- All codebases should have a README.md file at the project root. It must be a brief but  information dense document (optimised for human-readability) containing important context for understanding the application, intended to provide new developers with sufficient information to begin contributing to the codebase. It should include:
	  - The name of the application
	  - A high-level description of the primary goal(s) of the application
	  - Instructions on how to setup and run the application (and test suite).
	  - An explanation of the layout of the codebase 
- Comments should be used sparingly. As far as possible, code should be self-documenting. Here are some general principles which often help:
	- Descriptive naming.
	- Complex logic broken down into well-named single-responsibility chunks (clean abstractions).
	- Use named constants.
	- No magic numbers.
# Software Testing
- I don't believe in 100% test coverage, but please identify parts of the code which would benefit from testing and raise this with me.
# Python-specific
- Type annotate everything.
	- Make the type annotations as readable as possible (prioritise readability over comprehensiveness).
	- Don't use typing.Dict, typing.List etc. (you can use the base types dict, list etc. in type annotations).
	- After working on a piece of code, use `uv run ty check` to check that your type annotations are correct (you may need to install ty using `uv add --dev ty`)
- All classes and functions should have google-style docstrings.
- Use assert statements frequently as lightweight validation of the expected state of the system.
	- Always include a short assert message.
- Aim for high cohesion within modules and low coupling between them.
- Unless you are only providing a single argument and it is obvious what that argument is, always use named arguments when calling a function.
## Python Error Handling 
- Exceptions are an important signal and should not be thoughtlessly suppressed.
- Unexpected program behaviour must raise an exception (don't try to catch developer mistakes with error-handling code).
- A bare try/except may only be used at the most top end-user-facing level of the application (if at all). All other exceptions must bubble up.
